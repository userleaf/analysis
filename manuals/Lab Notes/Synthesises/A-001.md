# 4 ML Thick $\ce{CdSe}$ Nanoplatelets.

* **340 mg** of *cadmium myristate*, **24 mg** of *Se*, and **30 mL** of *ODE* placed into the **100 mL** three-neck flask and degassed at **90 °C** for **30 min**. 

* The solution was heated to **240 °C** under *nitrogen* with a rate of **10−12 °C/min**. 

* When the temperature reached **185−190 °C**, **80 mg** of *cadmium acetate dihydrate* swiftly added to the reaction mixture. 

* The reaction solution was kept at **240 °C** for **10 mins** for the growth of NPLs. 

* After the growth, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature with the addition of **1 mL** of *oleic acid*. 

* For the cleaning step, **5 mL** of *n-hexane* was added to the resulting solution, and it was put into a **50mL** centrifuge tube for centrifugation. 

* After centrifugation, the *precipitate* was discarded, and the *supernatant* was divided into **two** parts. With the addition of **6 mL** of *ethanol* to each part, **4ML thick *CdSe* NPLs** were precipitated by centrifugation. 

* Then, the precipitated *CdSe NPLs* were dissolved in **6 mL** of hexane andcleaned one more time with the addition of **3 mL** of *ethanol*.

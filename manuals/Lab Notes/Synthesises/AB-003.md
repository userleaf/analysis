> Core > A-001
> Shell > $\ce{CdSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}}$


* In **50ml** three necked flask **430uL** *A-001*, **5mL** *ODE*, **30mg** $\ce{Cd(Ac)_2.H2O}$, and **45uL** *Oleic Acid* mixed and degassed at **80C** for **30mins**.
* Under *Nitrogen* the temperature set to **240C** when the temperature reached to **215C**, mixture of **3mL** *degassed ODE*, **45uL** *TOP-Se(1M)* and **45uL** *TOP-Te(1M)* injected with a rate of **2mL/h** until **1mL** of mixture injected.
*  After the injection **0.5mL** of *Oleic Acid* added to the mixture and the mixture cooled.
*  After cooling **5mL** of *n-hexane* added and centifuged for **10 mins**.
*  The precipitate dissolved in *toluene* for storage.
